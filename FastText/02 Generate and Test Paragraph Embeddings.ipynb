In the EU and EEA, infectious diseases are the most common cause of illness in migrant children living in refugee camps and other reception areas, including acute respiratory tract infections, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, and skin infection (e.g., scabies, pediculosis); gastrointestinal infection (e.g., shigellosis); typhoid fever; hepatitis A; tuberculosis; and malaria [25 , 26].

The conditions and mechanisms behind animal-to-human spillover are unknown.---10.1371/journal.pone.0084679--- Infectious diseases occur frequently within last twenty years.---10.1101/2020.02.26.20028571--- Almost three-quarters of all grants were for noncommunicable diseases (72% ; 40,035), followed by communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions (20% ; 11,123) and injuries (6% ; 3056) (Table 4, Fig. Among non-communicable diseases , 24% (9483 grants) were for malignant neoplasms, followed by mental and substance use disorders (15% ; 5945), neurological conditions (12% ; 4981), and cardiovascular diseases (11% ; 4473).
