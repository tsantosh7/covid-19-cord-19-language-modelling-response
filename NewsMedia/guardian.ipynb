G7 leaders will hold a conference call on Monday to discuss the crisis – a chance to agree new measures to protect their economies. But the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, played down the suggestion the US could be falling into recession. insisting coronavirus will be a short-lived problem. “Later in the year, obviously, the economic activity will pick up as we confront this virus,” Mnuchin told ABC. The coronavirus pandemic has also hurt Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil giant. Saudi Aramco promised to cut its spending this year to weather the coronavirus pandemic, after revealing on Sunday that its oil revenues fell by more than a fifth last year because of lower oil prices.\\nAramco reported a worse than expected net profit of $88.2bn (£69.9bn) in 2019, down from $111.1bn in 2018, because of lower oil prices. The world’s most profitable company said it plans to spend between $25bn to $30bn this year, down from $32.8bn last year, after the Covid-19 virus wiped out oil demand forecasts for 2020. The benchmark oil price averaged $64.26 a barrel last year, down from $71.34 a barrel the year before. The current price is below $34 a barrel and is forecast to remain low as the virus threatens a global economic recession. The oil markets recorded their steepest price drop since the 1991 Gulf war, to lows of $33 a barrel last week, after Saudi Arabia waged an oil price war against rival “petro-nations” by vowing to ramp up oil production to record highs. The kingdom instructed Aramco last week to raise the maximum rate of oil it can comfortably produce to 13m barrels of oil a day to secure its market share against rising oil exports from Russia and the US.'"
