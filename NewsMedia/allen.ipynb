       "'The coronavirus pandemic has stalled scientific fieldwork and may even start to affect the monitoring of the climate, scientists have warned. Major projects to gather environmental data have been postponed or canceled over concerns that teams of researchers working together will spread the Covid-19 virus. The crisis has so far mainly stymied long-term studies, but concerns have been raised that routine monitoring of weather and the climate crisis may be affected if the pandemic drags on for an extended period.\\nPetteri Taalas, secretary general of World Meteorological Organization, said: “The impacts of climate change and growing amount of weather-related disasters continue. “The Covid-19 pandemic poses an additional challenge, and may exacerbate multi-hazard risks at a single-country level. Therefore it is essential that governments pay attention to their national early warning and weather-observing capacities despite the Covid-19 crisis.” Wealthy countries that have deployed land- and ocean-based instruments, as well as satellites, to gauge temperature changes and other readings mostly have done so with fully or partly automated systems. This means that data will continue to flow without much hands-on human input but should the pandemic stretch out for many more weeks then missed repairs and replacements of instruments will become an “increasing concern”, according to the WMO. Furthermore, in many developing countries measurements are routinely taken manually by scientists in the field and there are indications this work has dropped off. A huge slump in air travel since the start of the pandemic has dented the collection of ambient temperature and wind speed taken in-flight by sensors fitted to commercial airliners through an initiative called the Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay program. A coalition of national weather services across Europe are discussing how to compensate for the decrease in the 700,000 climate observations normally provided per day by aircraft. In the US, a swath of climate research work has been called off or delayed. Nasa-led missions to survey the loss of land in the Mississippi River delta and hurricane recovery in Puerto Rico have been suspended. With all flights to and from Greenland suspended, a project to collect cores from the country’s vast ice sheet has been voided for the year. Nasa has asked staff to work remotely where possible, with a spokesman telling the Guardian that the agency has a continuity plan to ensure that there is “no interruption of climate-relevant data”. A five-year Nasa project to study the impact of severe thunderstorms that enter the stratosphere is now mired in uncertainty. Researchers from several universities have partnered with Nasa to use its high-altitude ER-2 aircraft to take measurements this summer but this work is now on hold. “Because of the delays we haven’t started tests yet and it’s not clear if we are going to be able to do that,” said Kenneth Bowman, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, who is working on the project. “We don’t really know the timings, we are taking it week to week. It’s always frustrating having all of your plans disrupted, not knowing when we will do what we want to do.” Bowman said routine climate monitoring is “robust” and that he would be surprised if the pandemic disrupted this work unless it spooled out for many months or years. Gabriel Vecchi, a climate modeler at Princeton University, said while he was concerned about the impact of the pandemic on data collection he was “quite heartened” that observations of the Earth’s surface have continued unabated so far. “We should all be grateful for the people and organizations that are continuing these essential forecast and monitoring operations, in spite of the severe challenges they are facing,” he said. If the pandemic lingers then climate scientists will face challenges shared by some other professions – meetings of teams will have to be reorientated, the maintenance of equipment will somehow have to be done and trips to research sites will be curtailed. This is occurring at a time when air pollution, as well as planet-heating gases, has declined considerably in China and Europe due to a reduction in human activity. “For the most part these polluted areas have snuck up on people and they have become the norm and when the public realize it doesn’t have to be that way, I can imagine considerable pressures to not let it go back to how it was,” said Kevin Trenberth, a veteran climate scientist. “I can imagine that commuting from home may become a lot more common as we move ahead, to the advantage of the climate system and fossil fuel use, and to everyone.”'"

Despite the flourishing of social media, information is more tightly controlled in China than ever. In 2013, an internal Communist party edict known as Document No 9 ordered cadres to tackle seven supposedly subversive influences on society. These included western-inspired notions of press freedom, “universal values” of human rights, civil rights and civic participation. Even within the Communist party, cadres are threatened with disciplinary action for expressing opinions that differ from the leadership. Compared with 17 years ago, Chinese citizens enjoy even fewer rights of speech and expression. A few days after 34-year-old Li posted a note in his medical school alumni social media group on 30 December, stating that seven workers from a local live-animal market had been diagnosed with an illness similar to Sars and were quarantined in his hospital, he was summoned by police.

Police are still engaged in a campaign to detain Chinese netizens for spreading so-called “rumours”. Rumours included reports of potential cases, including people turned away from hospitals or dying without ever being tested and quickly cremated, criticism of the government, the distribution of masks, or the criticism of the discrimination of people from Wuhan or others who may be infected. Activists have been threatened with jail if they share foreign news articles or post on social media about the coronavirus outbreak. That the Chinese government can lock millions of people into cities with almost no advance notice should not be considered anything other than terrifying. The residents of Wuhan had no time to buy food, medicine, or other essentials. Authorities hastily announced the lockdown in the middle of the night with an eight-hour gap before it went into effect, giving people time to flee and thus raising questions on the rationale for such extreme measures. International law is clear that during a time of public health emergency, any restrictions on human rights should be based on legality, necessity, proportionality and grounded in evidence. The international community should support all efforts to end this outbreak, but human rights should not be a casualty to the coronavirus crisis. The WHO declares that core principles of human rights and health includes accountability, equality and non-discrimination and participation. It even acknowledges that “participation is important to accountability as it provides … checks and balances which do not allow unitary leadership to exercise power in an arbitrary manner”. The WHO’s admiration for the unitary actions of the Chinese dictator Xi Jinping exercising power in an arbitrary manner is a direct contradiction of its own human rights principles.'),\n",

It also mandates jail time for intentionally spreading disinformation that hampers the coronavirus response, measures that were roundly criticised by the opposition at home and politicians abroad. The gender regulation, part of a larger bill on a number of issues not related to coronavirus, will still be considered by parliament in the normal way. It shows that even as Orbán requested special measures for fighting coronavirus, his government had not forgotten its other battles. Trans rights and so-called “gender ideology” are frequent bugbears of alt-right and conservative politicians, and Orbán’s government has previously introduced a measure that in effect banned universities from teaching gender studies. Trans people have had trouble legally changing their documents since 2018, Reuters reported, a situation that is currently subject to several legal challenges. The proposed bill would enshrine this denial of changes in law. The Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights, Dunja Mijatović, called on Hungary’s parliament not to adopt the law, and said the measure was in contravention of human rights standards and the case law of the European court of human rights. “Transgender persons have the right to legal recognition of their gender based on self-determination. This is an essential step to ensure respect for their human rights in all areas of life. Legal gender recognition is a matter of human dignity,” she said in a statement on Thursday. At home, human rights activists also criticised the bill. “It is appalling that the government plans to ban legal gender recognition in the shadow of the coronavirus crisis,” Tamás Dombos, a board member of the Hungarian LGBT Alliance, told Agence France-Presse. “Such a measure would force trans people to live with documents that do not match their true identity and their appearance ... That exposes them to potential discrimination in employment, housing, access to goods and services, and official procedures,” he said.'),\n",

The first African country where a coup d’etat occurred after independence and where the elected head of state was assassinated, Togo stands to be the last country in Africa to see the lights of a democratic alternation. On Saturday, the country goes to the polls. But on past evidence, things are unlikely to change. It was on 13 January 1963 that Gnassingbé Eyadéma, father of the current president, killed the first post-colonial president, Sylvanus Olympio, in a military coup. Now, 57 years later, the Gnassingbé family still is in power. Only North Korea’s ruling dynasty has held executive power for longer. There have been six presidential elections in Togo since the democratic movements of the 1990s, all won by the Gnassingbé family. Before the first multiparty presidential election, in 1993, protesters were shot on the streets, and the persecution of political opponents triggered an unprecedented wave of migration to neighbouring countries that re-established Gnassingbé’s dictatorial power. Gross human rights abuses caused international donors to suspend development assistance. Eyadema Gnassingbé ultimately “won” more than 95% of the vote with a turnout of less than 36%. On 21 June 1998, the second multiparty presidential election was held. Eyadema Gnassingbé, seeing the vote going towards opposition parties, had the country’s telecommunication lines and electric grid shut down, successfully halting the transmission of results from polling stations. The president of the electoral commission resigned and the minister of the interior took charge of counting the vote. On 24 June he declared Gnassingbé Eyadema elected, with 52% of the votes.'),\n",

As a result, they were denied entry and returned to Fiji last night,” the Samoan government said in a statement on the weekend. Jorge Contesse, the director of the Center for Transnational Law at Rutgers Law School in the US, said the incident was potentially a violation of international law. “It is a violation of human rights international law for a country to deny the right of return of their own national. There is a human right to return to your home country and countries cannot deprive you of this right in a way that is arbitrary. That is a principle enshrined in UN human rights, and is a basic international human right as observed through human instruments and the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),” said Contesse. Samoa is a party to the ICCPR and acceded in 2008. “It is a fundamental right. On the understanding that your country is the place you feel safe in, therefore it is unlawful for your own country to deny re-entry,” said Contesse. In an editorial on Wednesday, the Fiji Sun newspaper condemned the decision, saying it was “morally wrong for Samoa to refuse entry to eight of its citizens”, calling it “unacceptable and tantamount to dereliction of duty by a sovereign state”. The Samoan government has introduced stringent quarantine measures for the coronavirus – now called Covid-19 – as it is dealing with intense criticism of its handling the measles epidemic that killed more than 80 people in 2019. The government has also been criticised for its initial response to the coronavirus, with the Samoan government initially saying Samoan students would not be evacuated from Wuhan, though four were later evacuated on the Air New Zealand flight and are being quarantined in New Zealand. A parent of a Samoan student in Wuhan wrote on social media: “We must be the only country turning away our own citizens to be quarantined elsewhere. What is the difference of being quarantined in Fiji and not Faleolo hospital as been advertised? This is most bizarre.” According to Contesse the violation is determined by the arbitrary nature of the decision to deny reentry.'),\n",

The shadow business secretary has argued that Labour’s green industrial revolution, which she authored, was not prominent enough in the party’s election campaign last year. She would seek to redraw clause IV of the party’s constitution, which sets out its political aims, to include environmentalism, she said on Wednesday. “As leader, I’ll centre Labour’s plans to tackle the climate crisis in everything our party does, and make sure it defines the next election. I know that we can build a winning electoral coalition around our green industrial revolution, uniting working people everywhere with a just, aspirational response to the climate crisis,” she told the Guardian. Any changes to Labour’s constitution would have to be agreed by party members at its annual conference; however, Long-Bailey set out a series of principles that she said should guide the process of drawing up what she called a “clause IV for our time”. The first of these is “a green economy and a sustainable planet, recognising that socialism and environmentalism must go hand in hand”. Other principles include: • Universal provision of high-quality public services, including childcare, education, healthcare, housing, social care, social security, transport and utilities. • A prosperous economy with a more equal distribution of wealth, ownership and economic power. • An independent foreign policy based on peace, internationalism, human rights, justice and international law. • Expanding democracy and devolving power. Long-Bailey is widely regarded as Jeremy Corbyn’s chosen successor. He made a video alongside her last week in which the pair chatted about climate change, and he promised “absolute support” for her “green revolution”. However, Keir Starmer appears to be the frontrunner. The long leadership campaign has featured increasingly detailed policy promises, with Starmer publishing “10 pledges”, which include nationalisation of “rail, mail, energy and water” and supporting the abolition of tuition fees. Meanwhile, Lisa Nandy, the MP for Wigan, has sought to shake up the race by warning that Labour faces extinction unless it changes radically. Long-Bailey has made clear that she is committed to retaining Corbyn’s leftwing policy stance but stressed that she believes it could have been explained and promoted better during the election campaign, saying her colleagues need to become “salespeople for socialism”. And she has also emphasised widening party democracy – committing to campaign for open selection for MPs. Long-Bailey’s campaign chair, Jon Lansman, founder of the leftwing Labour group Momentum, has long advocated open selection. Clause IV was originally agreed in 1918. It was rewritten in 1995, under Tony Blair’s leadership, to eliminate the commitment to “the common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange” after a highly symbolic public battle with the trades unions.'),\n",

At an emergency virtual meeting last Thursday, G20 leaders took steps in the right direction. But we are still far away from having a coordinated, articulated global response that meets the unprecedented magnitude of what we are facing. Far from flattening the curve of infection, we are still well behind it. The disease initially took 67 days to infect 100,000 people; soon, 100,000 people and more will be infected daily. Without concerted and courageous action, the number of new cases will almost certainly escalate into the millions, pushing health systems to breaking point, economies into a nosedive and people into despair, with the poorest hit hardest. We must prepare for the worst and do everything to avoid it. Here is a three-point call to action – based on science, solidarity and smart policies – for doing just that. First, suppress transmission of the coronavirus. This requires aggressive and early testing and contact tracing, complemented by quarantines, treatment and measures to keep first responders safe, combined with measures to restrict movement and contact. Such steps, despite the disruptions they cause, must be sustained until therapies and a vaccine emerge. Crucially, this robust and cooperative effort should be guided by the World Health Organization, a member of the United Nations family; countries acting on their own – as they must for their people – will not get the job done for all. Second, tackle the devastating social and economic dimensions of the crisis. The virus is spreading like wildfire, and is likely to move swiftly into the global south, where health systems face constraints, people are more vulnerable, and millions live in densely populated slums or crowded settlements for refugees and internally displaced persons. Fuelled by such conditions, the virus could devastate the developing world and then re-emerge where it was previously suppressed. In our interconnected world, we are only as strong as the weakest health systems. Clearly, we must fight the virus for all of humanity, with a focus on people, especially the most affected: women, older people, youth, low-wage workers, small and medium enterprises, the informal sector and vulnerable groups. The United Nations has just issued reports documenting how the viral contagion has become an economic contagion, and setting out the financing needed to address the shocks. The International Monetary Fund has declared that we have entered a recession as bad as or worse than in 2009. We need a comprehensive multilateral response amounting to a double-digit percentage of global gross domestic product. Developed countries can do it by themselves, and some are indeed doing it. But we must massively increase the resources available to the developing world by expanding the capacity of the IMF, namely through the issuance of special drawing rights, and of the other international financial institutions so that they can rapidly inject resources into the countries that need them. I know this is difficult as nations find themselves increasing domestic spending by record amounts. But that spending will be in vain if we don’t control the virus. Coordinated swaps among central banks can also bring liquidity to emerging economies. Debt alleviation must also be a priority – including immediate waivers on interest payments for 2020. Third, recover better. We simply cannot return to where we were before Covid-19 struck, with societies unnecessarily vulnerable to crisis. The pandemic has reminded us, in the starkest way possible, of the price we pay for weaknesses in health systems, social protections and public services. It has underscored and exacerbated inequalities, above all gender inequity, laying bare the way in which the formal economy has been sustained on the back of invisible and unpaid care labour. It has highlighted ongoing human rights challenges, including stigma and violence against women. Now is the time to redouble our efforts to build more inclusive and sustainable economies and societies that are more resilient in the face of pandemics, climate change and other global challenges. The recovery must lead to a different economy. Our roadmap remains the 2030 agenda and sustainable development goals. The United Nations system is fully mobilised: supporting country responses, placing our supply chains at the world’s disposal, and advocating for a global ceasefire. Ending the pandemic everywhere is both a moral imperative and a matter of enlightened self-interest. At this unusual moment, we cannot resort to the usual tools. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures. We face a colossal test which demands decisive, coordinated and innovative action from all, for all. • António Guterres is secretary general of the United Nations'),\n",

But he was disappointed. Erskine recalls the young law student’s politics as being of the “non-aligned, conscience-driven left” – something like a kind of political Methodism. Instead of joining in the running battles with Militant, Starmer took the view there were “no enemies on the left” and cracked on with his studies. The overwhelming favourite to succeed Jeremy Corbyn, who steps down next weekend, Starmer has defied categorisation, declining to become a fully paid-up member of any of Labour’s many overlapping sects. He is neither a Corbynite nor a Blairite (to the extent that they still exist) and is irritated by other people’s urge to pigeon-hole him. Speaking to the Guardian as he launched his pitch for the leadership last December, he said: “I don’t find the badging of people helps, really. I don’t need somebody else’s name tattooed on my head to know what I think. There are fundamental principles.” Starmer arrived at Leeds from Reigate grammar school, the only one of five siblings from a modest semi-detached house in Oxted, Surrey, to get to university. He has spoken movingly about his mother’s 50-year battle with Still’s disease, which ultimately led to her being confined to a wheelchair and unable to eat. “She wouldn’t have moaned. If you’d asked her how she was, she’d say ‘fine, how are you?’,” he said. After a postgraduate degree at Oxford, Starmer moved to London where he shared a rickety flat in Archway with old school friends. He joined the fashionably radical Doughty Street Chambers while carrying out pro-bono work for a string of apparently lost causes. Conor Foley, an international human rights lawyer and aid worker who now lives in Brazil, worked alongside Starmer at the campaign group Amnesty International in the 90s. The pair wrote a pamphlet, Foreign Policy, Human Rights and the UK, in 1998, making a string of recommendations, many of which were subsequently taken up by the Labour government. Tony Blair’s incorporation of the provisions of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) into UK law in the Human Rights Act catapulted Starmer and his fellow human rights lawyers from the lefty fringe of their profession to the mainstream, as the judiciary scrambled to absorb its implications. “There were various people who were, three years before, on the unacceptable left, suddenly found themselves in positions of authority,” says Conor Gearty, a professor of human rights law at the LSE and another old friend. “Because we knew about it and nobody else did.” Foley agrees. “The Human Rights Act - there are probably four or five people in Britain who got that legislation and understood the importance of that legislation, and Keir and I were two of them. There were other people who played a more prominent role. But he has always understood the strategic significance of international human rights law.” Foley says that while the pair were working together at Amnesty he didn’t sense any burning ambition in Starmer to enter party politics. “That wasn’t where we were at. I think he wanted to be a human rights lawyer. I think that was really his dream.” And anyway the Labour party of the time wasn’t much to their liking, he says. “The Blairite party wouldn’t have been something either of us were comfortable with. Not that we were anti, we just weren’t that comfortable with it.” Starmer’s appointment as director of public prosecutions (DPP) – a campaigning human rights lawyer turned the nation’s chief prosecutor – surprised some of his radical friends. Leftwing critics tend to describe his five-year stint at the top of the 6,000-strong Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) as the final stage in Starmer’s metamorphosis from firebrand QC to well-coiffed pillar of the establishment. They point to the all-night court sittings held to administer swift punishment to the 2011 rioters – which Starmer subsequently claimed had helped quell the disorder; and tough prosecuting guidance that imposed sentences of up to 10 years on benefits fraudsters.'),\n",
